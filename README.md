# local_library
Example of a local library site with authorization and extended information about every book available.
The idea is to create a site for a local library with some cool features, that suggest its users full description of books available and their authors,
authorized have an opportunity to borrow a book online, that makes process way easier that a traditional way.
The best feature that will be added is a social networking side of a libarary.
Authorized user will be able to chat with eachother about books and whatnot. Also a comment section will be added soon.
